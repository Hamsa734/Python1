    "- Parent: A node that has one or more child nodes.\n",
    "- Child: A node directly connected to another node through an edge, representing a descendant.\n",
    "- Leaf Node: A node that has no children.\n",
    "- Subtree: A tree formed by any node and all its descendants.\n",
    "- Depth: The number of edges from the root node to the current node.\n",
    "- Height: The length of the longest path from a node to a leaf.\n",

    "- AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the height of the subtrees is maintained within a limited range.\n",
    "- Heap: A tree-based structure where the parent node is greater than its children in a max-heap or smaller in a min-heap.\n",

    "## Real-World Examples\n",
    "1. File Systems\n",
    "- In modern operating systems, the file system is often represented as a tree. \n",
    "- The root directory is the starting point, and each folder inside it represents a node. \n",
    "- Files are the leaf nodes because they do not have any children.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: In Windows, \"C:\" is the root, and \n",
    "- inside it are directories like \"Documents,\" \"Pictures,\" and \"Downloads.\" \n",
    "- These directories may contain other folders or files, forming a tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Organizational Hierarchy\n",
    "- Organizations often use tree structures to represent their hierarchy. \n",
    "- The CEO or top executive is at the root, \n",
    "- while department heads and employees form the branches and leaves of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: A CEO may have multiple VPs reporting to them, and \n",
    "- each VP has managers under them. Managers then have team members as their subordinates, \n",
    "- creating a tree-like organizational chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Decision Trees in Machine Learning\n",
    "- A decision tree is used in AI to model decisions and their possible outcomes.\n",
    "- Each node represents a decision point, and the branches represent the possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: In email classification, a decision tree may be used to determine \n",
    "- if an email is spam based on certain attributes (keywords, sender, etc.). \n",
    "- Each branch leads to a final decision (spam or not spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Binary Search Trees for Database Indexing\n",
    "- Binary Search Trees are used to maintain sorted data, \n",
    "- which allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: When you search for a specific record in a database, \n",
    "- the system uses a binary search tree to narrow down the search by comparing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. HTML DOM Tree\n",
    "- The Document Object Model (DOM) in HTML is another example of a tree structure. \n",
    "- The root node is the html element, and branches represent different elements in the document, \n",
    "- such as head, body, div, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: A web browser processes the DOM tree to render the webpage. \n",
    "- Each HTML tag is a node, and its attributes and contents are children of that node.\n"
